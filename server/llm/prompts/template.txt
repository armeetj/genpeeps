Follow these steps exactly.

1)  Describe the uploaded image in words. What is the person wearing?
    Do they have accessories on? Any headdresses? What hair style do they have?
    What body type? What expression is on their face? Do they have facial hair?
    Is it thick? How much of the face does it cover? Are they wearing glasses?
    What are they wearing? What is their ethnicity? Be as descriptive as possible.

2)  Finally, study the following schema. For each property, make a choice out of
    the possible options. You can use your description of the image as well as
    the image itself to inform your decisions. Your output should be valid JSON
    that follows this schema.
